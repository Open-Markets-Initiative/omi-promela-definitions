 * Generated from the binary model. Every record is a run of fields, and spin checks the two
 * claims the model's rules call for: that encoding a record writes the bytes its fields say,
 * and that decoding those bytes gives the record back and consumes exactly what was written.
 *
 * A field is the bytes it occupies. Nothing is read as an integer: spin evaluates an int in
 * 32 bits, as TLC does, so a field wider than that has no range a checker could enumerate,
 * and bytes are exact at any width. No rule stated here depends on a value.
 *
 * Each record is checked at four patterns: every byte zero, every byte the space a text
 * field pads with, every byte with all bits set, and the ramp - each byte holding where it
 * lies, which is what catches a field written or read out of place.
 *
 * What this definition does not state, and the model does:
 *   - a length prefix framing what follows
